Python : Attendance Management System
I created this project in my first year training of python under SSDN technologies gurugram pvt. ltd. 

Project Description:
The project is all about managing the attendance of the student in the school with the proper authentication process of both students and staff members. It allows staff to add or remove the student with their generic details and on the other hand student can see their information on a dashboard through login.

Technology Stack:
> Python 3
> Sqlite Database
> Tkinter library for GUI creation.

To see how the GUI looks clone the project on your desktop and change the path variables of images or open the folder project_output_images.
Thank you.
